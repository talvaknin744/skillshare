## IDE Support (JSON Schema) {#ide-support}

Config files include a YAML Language Server directive that enables **autocompletion**, **validation**, and **hover documentation** in supported editors.

New configs created by `skillshare init` include this automatically:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runkids/skillshare/main/schemas/config.schema.json
source: ~/.config/skillshare/skills
targets:
  claude:
    path: ~/.claude/skills
```

### Adding to an existing config

If your config was created before this feature, add the comment as the **first line**:

**Global config** (`~/.config/skillshare/config.yaml`):
```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runkids/skillshare/main/schemas/config.schema.json
```

**Project config** (`.skillshare/config.yaml`):
```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runkids/skillshare/main/schemas/project-config.schema.json
```

Or simply re-run `skillshare init --force` (global) or `skillshare init -p --force` (project) to regenerate the config with the schema comment.

### Supported editors

| Editor | Extension required |
|--------|-------------------|
| VS Code | [YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) by Red Hat |
| JetBrains IDEs | Built-in YAML support |
| Neovim | [yaml-language-server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server) via LSP |

```

---

## Fields

### `source`

Path to your skills directory (single source of truth).

```yaml
source: ~/.config/skillshare/skills
```

**Default:** `~/.config/skillshare/skills`

### `mode`

Default sync mode for all targets.

```yaml
mode: merge
```

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `merge` | Each skill symlinked individually. Local skills preserved. **(default)** |
| `copy` | Each skill copied as real files. For AI CLIs that can't follow symlinks. |
| `symlink` | Entire target directory is one symlink. |

### `target_naming`

Default target naming strategy for merge/copy sync.

```yaml
target_naming: flat
```

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `flat` | Nested skills flattened with `__` separators (e.g. `frontend__dev`). **(default)** |
| `standard` | Uses the SKILL.md `name` field directly (e.g. `dev`). Follows the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification). |

### `targets`

AI CLI skill directories to sync to.

```yaml
targets:
  <name>:
    path: <path>
    mode: <mode>  # optional, overrides default
    include: [<glob>, ...]  # optional, merge/copy mode only
    exclude: [<glob>, ...]  # optional, merge/copy mode only
```

**Example:**
```yaml
targets:
  claude:
    path: ~/.claude/skills

  codex:
    path: ~/.codex/skills
    mode: symlink

  custom:
    path: ~/my-app/skills
```

### `include` / `exclude` (target filters)

Use per-target filters to control which skills are synced in **merge and copy modes**.

```yaml
targets:
  codex:
    path: ~/.codex/skills
    include: [codex-*]
  claude:
    path: ~/.claude/skills
    exclude: [codex-*]
```

Rules:
- Matching is against target flat names (for example `team__frontend__ui`)
- `include` is applied first
- `exclude` is applied after include
- Pattern syntax uses Go `filepath.Match` (`*`, `?`, `[...]`)
- In `symlink` mode, include/exclude is ignored
- If a previously synced source link becomes excluded, `sync` removes that target entry
- Local non-symlink folders that already existed in target are preserved

#### Pattern cheat sheet

| Pattern | Matches | Typical use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `codex-*` | `codex-agent`, `codex-rag` | Prefix-based grouping |
| `team__*` | `team__frontend__ui` | Repo/group namespace |
| `*-experimental` | `rag-experimental` | Suffix-based cleanup |
| `core-?` | `core-a`, `core-1` | Single-character variant |
| `[ab]-tool` | `a-tool`, `b-tool` | Small explicit set |

#### Scenario A: include only

Use `include` when a target should receive only a focused subset.

```yaml
targets:
  codex:
    path: ~/.codex/skills
    include: [codex-*, shared-*]
```

Use case:
- Keep Codex focused on coding workflows only
- Avoid sending writing/research-only skills to this target

#### Scenario B: exclude only

Use `exclude` when a target should receive almost everything except a known subset.

```yaml
targets:
  claude:
    path: ~/.claude/skills
    exclude: [*-experimental, codex-*]
```

Use case:
- Keep one main target broad
- Hide unstable or target-specific skills

#### Scenario C: include + exclude

Use both when you want a broad include, then carve out exceptions.

```yaml
targets:
  cursor:
    path: ~/.cursor/skills
    include: [core-*, team__*]
    exclude: [*-deprecated, team__legacy__*]
```

Evaluation order:
1. Keep only names matching `include`
2. Remove matches from `exclude`

Given source skills:
- `core-auth`
- `core-deprecated`
- `team__frontend__ui`
- `team__legacy__docs`
- `misc-tool`

Result for `cursor`:
- Synced: `core-auth`, `team__frontend__ui`
- Not synced: `core-deprecated`, `team__legacy__docs`, `misc-tool`

#### Managing filters via CLI

Instead of editing YAML manually, use the `target` command:

```bash
# Skills
skillshare target claude --add-include "team-*"
skillshare target claude --add-exclude "_legacy*"
skillshare target claude --remove-include "team-*"

# Agents (only for targets with an agents path)
skillshare target claude --add-agent-include "team-*"
skillshare target claude --add-agent-exclude "draft-*"
skillshare target claude --remove-agent-include "team-*"

skillshare sync  # Apply changes
```

Duplicate patterns are silently ignored. Invalid glob patterns return an error. Agent filters use the same glob syntax as skill filters, but only work in `merge` and `copy` modes. In `symlink` mode, agent filters are ignored because the entire agents directory is linked as one unit.

See [target command](/docs/reference/commands/target#target-filters-includeexclude) for full reference.

#### Skill-level targets {#skill-level-targets}

Skills can declare which targets they're compatible with using `metadata.targets` in SKILL.md. A top-level `targets` field is still supported as a fallback for older skills, but `metadata.targets` takes precedence when both are present:

```yaml
---
name: claude-prompts
metadata:
  targets: [claude]
---
```

This is a **second layer** of filtering that works alongside config-level include/exclude:

```
Source Skills
  │
  ├─ Config include/exclude    ← per-target, set by consumer
  │
  └─ Skill targets field       ← per-skill, set by author
      │
      ▼
  Skills synced to target
```

**Evaluation order:**
1. `include` — keep only matching names
2. `exclude` — remove matching names
3. `targets` field — remove skills whose targets list doesn't include this target

Both layers must pass (AND relationship). Config filters always take priority — even if a skill declares `targets: [claude]`, a config `exclude: [claude-*]` will still exclude it.

**Cross-mode matching:** `targets: [claude]` matches both the global target `claude` and the project target `claude`, because they refer to the same AI CLI. See [supported targets](/docs/reference/targets/supported-targets).

:::tip
Use config filters (`include`/`exclude`) when the **consumer** wants to control what goes where. Use skill-level `targets` when the **author** knows the skill only works with specific AI CLIs.
:::

#### Existing target entries when filters change

When you add or change filters, then run `skillshare sync`:

| Existing item in target | What happens |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| Source-linked symlink/junction that is now filtered out | Removed (unlinked) |
| Managed copy (copy mode) that is now filtered out | Removed |
| Local non-symlink directory created in target | Preserved |
| Unrelated local content | Preserved |

### `skills`

Tracks remotely-installed skills. Auto-managed by `skillshare install` and `skillshare uninstall`.

```yaml
skills:
  - name: pdf
    source: anthropics/skills/skills/pdf
  - name: _team-skills
    source: github.com/team/skills
    tracked: true
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Skill directory name |
| `source` | Yes | GitHub URL or local path |
| `tracked` | No | `true` if installed with `--track` (default: `false`) |

When you run `skillshare install` with no arguments, all listed skills that aren't already present are installed. This makes `config.yaml` a portable skill manifest — copy it to another machine and run `skillshare install && skillshare sync`.

The `skills:` list is automatically updated after each `install` and `uninstall` operation. You don't need to edit it manually.

:::note Migrated to .metadata.json
Starting from v0.16.2, installed skill entries moved from `config.yaml` to a separate file. In the current version, all installation metadata is stored in a centralized `.metadata.json` inside the `skills/` directory. Migration from older formats (`registry.yaml`, per-skill `.skillshare-meta.json`) is automatic on first run.
:::

### `agents_source` {#agents-source}

Custom source directory for agents. Overrides the default `~/.config/skillshare/agents/`.

```yaml
agents_source: ~/my-agents
```

When set, all agents are read from this directory instead of the default. Supports `~` expansion.

Default: `~/.config/skillshare/agents/` (auto-detected, no need to set explicitly unless you want a custom location).

:::note Global mode only
Project mode always uses `.skillshare/agents/` and does not support `agents_source`.
:::

See [Agents](/docs/understand/agents) for details on agent file format, sync behavior, and supported targets.

### `extras` {#extras}

Non-skill resources (rules, commands, prompts, etc.) to sync to arbitrary directories.

```yaml
extras_source: ~/my-extras            # optional global default source
extras:
  - name: rules
    source: ~/company-shared/rules    # optional per-extra override
    targets:
      - path: ~/.claude/rules
      - path: ~/.cursor/rules
        mode: copy
  - name: agents
    targets:
      - path: ~/.claude/agents
        flatten: true                 # sync subdirectory files flat
  - name: commands
    targets:
      - path: ~/.claude/commands
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Extra identifier |
| `source` | No | Custom source directory for this extra (overrides `extras_source` and default) |
| `targets` | Yes | List of target paths |
| `targets[].path` | Yes | Destination directory |
| `targets[].mode` | No | `merge` (default), `copy`, or `symlink` |
| `targets[].flatten` | No | When `true`, sync subdirectory files directly into target root (cannot use with `symlink`) |

`extras_source` is auto-populated to the default path (`~/.config/skillshare/extras/`) on `skillshare init` or first `extras init`. Override it to use a custom location for all extras.

**Source resolution** (three-level priority):
1. Per-extra `source` → exact path (e.g., `~/company-shared/rules`)
2. `extras_source` → `<extras_source>/<name>/` (e.g., `~/my-extras/rules/`)
3. Default → `~/.config/skillshare/extras/<name>/`

**Sync modes:**
- `merge` (default) — per-file symlinks
- `copy` — per-file copy
- `symlink` — entire directory symlink

Run `skillshare sync extras` to sync, or `skillshare sync --all` to sync skills + extras together.

:::info Both modes supported
Extras work in both global and project mode. In project mode, source is `.skillshare/extras/<name>/`.
:::

See [sync extras](/docs/reference/commands/sync#sync-extras) for usage details.

### `ignore`

Glob patterns for files to skip during sync.

```yaml
ignore:
  - "**/.DS_Store"
  - "**/.git/**"
  - "**/node_modules/**"
```

**Default patterns:**
- `**/.DS_Store`
- `**/.git/**`

### `gitlab_hosts`

Hostnames of self-managed GitLab instances that use nested subgroups. Hosts containing `gitlab` or `jihulab` in the name are detected automatically — this field is only needed for other custom domains.

```yaml
gitlab_hosts:
  - git.company.com
  - code.internal.io
```

When a hostname is listed here, `skillshare install` treats the full URL path as the repository (supporting nested subgroups up to 20 levels), instead of assuming the standard `owner/repo` two-segment split.

**Without `gitlab_hosts`:**
```bash
# git.company.com/team/frontend/ui → clones "team/frontend", subdir "ui"
skillshare install git.company.com/team/frontend/ui
```

**With `gitlab_hosts: [git.company.com]`:**
```bash
# git.company.com/team/frontend/ui → clones "team/frontend/ui" (full path)
skillshare install git.company.com/team/frontend/ui
```

**Workaround without config:** append `.git` to mark the end of the repo path:
```bash
skillshare install git.company.com/team/frontend/ui.git
```

Entries must be bare hostnames (no scheme, path, or port). They are normalized to lowercase.

#### Environment variable

For CI/CD pipelines that don't have a config file, use `SKILLSHARE_GITLAB_HOSTS` (comma-separated):

```bash
SKILLSHARE_GITLAB_HOSTS=git.company.com,code.internal.io skillshare install git.company.com/team/frontend/ui
```

When both the config file and env var are set, their values are **merged** (deduplicated). Invalid entries in the env var are silently skipped.

### `audit`

Security audit configuration.

```yaml
audit:
  block_threshold: CRITICAL
  profile: default
  dedupe_mode: global
  enabled_analyzers: [static, dataflow, tier, integrity]
```

| Field | Values | Default | Description |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `block_threshold` | `CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, `INFO` | `CRITICAL` | Minimum severity to block `skillshare install` |
| `profile` | `default`, `strict`, `permissive` | `default` | Audit profile preset (sets defaults for threshold and dedupe) |
| `dedupe_mode` | `legacy`, `global` | `global` | Finding deduplication mode |
| `enabled_analyzers` | Array of analyzer IDs | *(all)* | Allowlist of analyzers to run (omit for all) |

**Profiles** set sensible defaults that can be overridden by explicit field values:

| Profile | Threshold | Dedupe | Description |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `default` | `CRITICAL` | `global` | Same as current behavior |
| `strict` | `HIGH` | `global` | Stricter blocking for security-conscious teams |
| `permissive` | `CRITICAL` | `legacy` | Advisory-only, minimal blocking |

**Analyzer IDs:** `static`, `dataflow`, `tier`, `integrity`, `structure`, `cross-skill`

**Precedence:** CLI flags → project config → global config → profile defaults.

- `block_threshold` only controls when install is **blocked** — scanning always runs
- Use `--skip-audit` to bypass scanning for a single install
- Use `--force` to override a block (findings are still shown)

---

## Project Config

**Location:** `.skillshare/config.yaml` (in project root)

Project config uses a different format from global config.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runkids/skillshare/main/schemas/project-config.schema.json
# Targets — string or object form
targets:
  - claude                    # String: known target with defaults
  - cursor
  - name: custom-ide               # Object: custom path and mode
    path: ./tools/ide/skills
    mode: symlink
  - name: codex                    # Object with filters
    include: [codex-*]
    exclude: [codex-experimental-*]

# Remote skills — auto-managed by install/uninstall
skills:
  - name: pdf
    source: anthropic/skills/pdf
  - name: _team-skills
    source: github.com/team/skills
    tracked: true                  # Cloned with git history

# Audit — same fields as global
audit:
  block_threshold: HIGH
  profile: strict
```

### `targets` (project)

Supports two YAML forms:

| Form | Example | When to use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **String** | `- claude` | Known target, default path and merge mode |
| **Object** | `- name: x, path: ..., mode: ..., include: [...], exclude: [...]` | Custom path, mode override, or per-target filters |

### `skills` (project)

Same schema as the [global `skills` field](#skills). Auto-managed by `skillshare install -p` and `skillshare uninstall -p`.

:::tip Portable Manifest
`config.yaml` is a portable skill manifest — in both global and project mode. Run `skillshare install && skillshare sync` on a new machine (or `skillshare install -p` in a project) to reproduce the same setup.
:::

## Managing Config

### View current config

```bash
skillshare status
# Shows source, targets, modes
```

### Edit config directly

```bash
# Open in editor
$EDITOR ~/.config/skillshare/config.yaml

# Then sync to apply changes
skillshare sync
```

### Reset config

```bash
rm ~/.config/skillshare/config.yaml
skillshare init
```

---

## Custom Audit Rules

**Location:**

| Mode | Path |
|------|------|
| Global | `~/.config/skillshare/audit-rules.yaml` |
| Project | `.skillshare/audit-rules.yaml` |

Rules are merged in order: **built-in → global → project**. You can add new rules, disable built-in rules, or override severity.

```yaml
rules:
  # Add a custom rule
  - id: flag-todo
    severity: MEDIUM
    pattern: todo-comment
    message: "TODO comment found"
    regex: '(?i)\bTODO\b'

  # Disable a built-in rule
  - id: insecure-http-0
    enabled: false
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Unique rule identifier |
| `severity` | Yes | `CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, `INFO` |
| `pattern` | Yes | Pattern category name |
| `message` | Yes | Human-readable finding description |
| `regex` | Yes | Regular expression to match |
| `exclude` | No | Suppress match when line also matches this regex |
| `enabled` | No | Set `false` to disable a built-in rule |

To scaffold a starter file:

```bash
skillshare audit --init-rules       # Global
skillshare audit --init-rules -p    # Project
```

See [audit command](/docs/reference/commands/audit) for full details.

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SKILLSHARE_CONFIG` | Override config file path |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | For API rate limit issues |

**Example:**
```bash
SKILLSHARE_CONFIG=~/custom-config.yaml skillshare status
```

---

## Skill Metadata

When you install a skill, skillshare records its metadata in the centralized `.metadata.json` file:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "pdf",
      "source": "anthropics/skills/skills/pdf",
      "type": "github",
      "installed_at": "2026-01-20T15:30:00Z",
      "repo_url": "https://github.com/anthropics/skills.git",
      "subdir": "skills/pdf",
      "version": "abc1234"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each skill entry includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Skill directory name |
| `source` | Original install source input |
| `type` | Source type (`github`, `local`, etc.) |
| `installed_at` | Installation timestamp |
| `repo_url` | Git clone URL (git sources only) |
| `subdir` | Subdirectory path (monorepo sources only) |
| `version` | Git commit hash at install time |

This is used by `skillshare update` and `skillshare check` to know where to fetch updates from.

**Don't edit this file manually.**

## Platform Differences

### macOS / Linux

```yaml
source: ~/.config/skillshare/skills
targets:
  claude:
    path: ~/.claude/skills
```

Uses symlinks.

### Windows

```yaml
source: %AppData%\skillshare\skills
targets:
  claude:
    path: %USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills
```

Uses NTFS junctions (no admin required).

---

### `plugins_source`

Path to the native plugin bundle source directory.

```yaml
plugins_source: ~/.config/skillshare/plugins
```

Default:

- Global mode: `~/.config/skillshare/plugins`
- Project mode: fixed at `.skillshare/plugins`

### `hooks_source`

Path to the standalone hook bundle source directory.

```yaml
hooks_source: ~/.config/skillshare/hooks
```

Default:

- Global mode: `~/.config/skillshare/hooks`
- Project mode: fixed at `.skillshare/hooks`

Notes:

- Project mode always uses the fixed `.skillshare/plugins` and `.skillshare/hooks` roots.
- Plugin and hook management currently target only Claude and Codex.
