# doctor

Check environment and diagnose issues with your skillshare setup.

```bash
skillshare doctor
skillshare doctor -p        # Project mode (.skillshare/config.yaml)
skillshare doctor -g        # Force global mode
skillshare doctor --json    # Structured JSON output for CI
```

## When to Use

- Something isn't working and you don't know why
- After upgrading skillshare or your OS
- Verify all targets, git, and symlinks are healthy
- Check whether plugin and hook bundles have been rendered to their managed roots
- First diagnostic step before filing a bug report

## Checks Performed

### Environment

| Check | What It Verifies |
|-------|-----------------|
| Config | Config file exists and is valid |
| Source | Source directory exists and is readable |
| Agents source | Agents source directory exists (if configured) |
| Skillignore | `.skillignore` (and `.skillignore.local`) active patterns and ignored skill count |
| Link support | System can create symlinks |
| Git | Repository status and remote configuration |

### Targets

Each target shows sub-items for **skills** and **agents** (when agents are configured):
- Skills: path, sync mode, sync state, shared/local counts
- Agents: linked count, drift detection
- No broken symlinks
- Duplicate-skill checks for unintended local collisions:
  - `merge` mode: skipped (local skills are expected)
  - `copy` mode: manifest-managed copies are ignored; only local colliding copies are warned
- Valid include/exclude glob patterns
- Info-level per-target compatibility hint when applicable (example target priority: `cursor` → `antigravity` → `copilot` → `opencode`; no hint when these targets are absent)

### Version

- CLI version
- skillshare skill version
- Checks for available updates

### Skill Integrity

For installed skills with file hash metadata, doctor verifies that no files have been tampered with since installation:

- Compares current SHA-256 hashes against stored hashes
- Reports modified, missing, and added files per skill
- Local skills (not in `.metadata.json`) are silently skipped — this is expected
- Installed skills with metadata but missing `file_hashes` are flagged with their names

```text
⚠ _team-repo__api-helper: 1 modified, 1 missing
✓ Skill integrity: 5/6 verified
⚠ Skill integrity: 1 skill(s) missing file hashes: _old-repo__legacy-skill
```

### Extras

When extras are configured, verifies:
- Source directory exists for each extra
- Target directories are reachable
- Reports missing source directories or unreachable targets

### Plugins

When plugin bundles exist, doctor checks whether each bundle has been rendered to its actually supported marketplace roots:

- Claude: `.skillshare/rendered/claude-marketplace/plugins/<name>/` in project mode, or `~/.config/skillshare/rendered/claude-marketplace/plugins/<name>/` globally
- Codex: `.agents/plugins/<name>/` in project mode, or `~/.agents/plugins/<name>/` globally

### Hooks

When hook bundles exist, doctor checks whether each supported target-specific managed hook root exists:

- Claude: `.claude/hooks/skillshare/<name>/` or `~/.claude/hooks/skillshare/<name>/`
- Codex: `.codex/hooks/skillshare/<name>/` or `~/.codex/hooks/skillshare/<name>/`

### Other

- Skills without `SKILL.md` files
- Skill-level `targets:` field validation (warns on unknown target names)
- Last backup timestamp (global mode)
- Trash status (item count, total size, oldest item age)
- Broken symlinks in targets

:::note Project Mode
When a project has `.skillshare/config.yaml`, `skillshare doctor` auto-runs in project mode.

In project mode:
- Config/source checks use `.skillshare/config.yaml` and `.skillshare/skills`
- Trash status uses `.skillshare/trash`
- Backups show `not used in project mode`
:::

## Common Issues

### "Needs sync"

Target mode was changed but not applied:

```bash
skillshare sync
```

### "Not synced"

Target has fewer linked skills than source (e.g. after installing new skills):

```bash
skillshare sync
```

### "Has uncommitted changes"

Tracked repo has local changes:

```bash
cd ~/.config/skillshare/skills/_team-repo
git status
# Commit or discard changes
```

### "Broken symlink"

A skill was removed from source but symlink remains:

```bash
skillshare sync  # Will prune orphaned symlinks
```

### "Skills without SKILL.md"

Skill folders missing required file:

```bash
# Add SKILL.md to each skill, or remove the folder
skillshare new my-skill  # Creates proper structure
```

### "Link not supported"

On Windows without Developer Mode:

1. Enable Developer Mode in Settings
2. Or run as Administrator

## JSON Output

Use `--json` for machine-readable output in CI pipelines and automation:

```bash
skillshare doctor --json
```

```json
{
  "checks": [
    { "name": "source", "status": "pass", "message": "Source: ~/.config/skillshare/skills (12 skills)" },
    { "name": "skillignore", "status": "pass", "message": ".skillignore: 3 patterns, 2 skills ignored", "details": ["test-*", "vendor/", "!important", "---", "test-draft", "vendor/lib"] },
    { "name": "sync_drift", "status": "warning", "message": "claude: 1 skill(s) not synced (7/8 linked)", "details": ["new-skill"] },
    { "name": "broken_symlinks", "status": "error", "message": "cursor: 1 broken symlink(s)", "details": ["old-skill"] }
  ],
  "plugins": [
    { "name": "demo", "source_dir": "/home/user/.config/skillshare/plugins/demo", "has_claude": true, "has_codex": true }
  ],
  "hooks": [
    { "name": "audit", "source_dir": "/home/user/.config/skillshare/hooks/audit", "targets": { "claude": 2, "codex": 1 } }
  ],
  "summary": { "total": 14, "pass": 12, "warnings": 1, "errors": 1, "info": 0 },
  "version": { "current": "0.17.4", "latest": "0.18.0", "update_available": true }
}
```

Check statuses: `pass`, `warning`, `error`, `info`. The `info` status is used for informational checks (e.g., `.skillignore` not found) that are neither passing nor failing. Info checks count toward `total` but not toward `pass`, `warnings`, or `errors`.

### Exit Codes

| Condition | Exit Code |
|-----------|-----------|
| All checks pass (or warnings only) | `0` |
| Any check has `error` status | `1` |

### CI Example

```bash
# Fail pipeline if doctor finds errors
skillshare doctor --json | jq -e '.summary.errors == 0'

# Extract warnings for notification
skillshare doctor --json | jq '[.checks[] | select(.status == "warning")]'
```

:::tip Web Dashboard
The **Health Check** page in the web dashboard (`skillshare ui`) provides a visual version of `doctor --json` with filter toggles and expandable details.
