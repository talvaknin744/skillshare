# FAQ

Frequently asked questions about skillshare.

## General

### Isn't this just `ln -s`?

Yes, at its core. But skillshare handles:
- Multi-target detection
- Backup/restore
- Merge mode (per-skill symlinks)
- Cross-device sync
- Broken symlink recovery

So you don't have to.

### What happens if I modify a skill in the target directory?

Since targets are symlinks, changes are made directly to the source. All targets see the change immediately.

### How do I keep a CLI-specific skill?

Use `merge` mode (default). Local skills in the target won't be overwritten or synced.

```bash
skillshare target claude --mode merge
skillshare sync
```

Then create skills directly in `~/.claude/skills/` — they won't be touched.

### I use a dotfiles manager (stow/chezmoi/yadm) — will skillshare break my symlinks?

No. Skillshare detects external symlinks on both source and target directories and preserves them. All commands — sync, update, uninstall, list, diff, install — resolve symlinks and operate on the underlying directories without removing the links themselves. See [Dotfiles Manager Compatibility](/docs/reference/commands/sync#dotfiles-manager-compatibility) for details.

## Installation

### Can I sync skills to a custom or uncommon tool?

Yes. Use `skillshare target add <name> <path>` with the tool's skills directory.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.myapp/skills
skillshare target add myapp ~/.myapp/skills
skillshare sync
```

### Can I use skillshare with a private git repo?

Yes. Use SSH URLs:

```bash
skillshare init --remote git@github.com:you/private-skills.git
```

---

## Sync

### Why do I need to run `sync` after every install/update?

Sync is intentionally a separate step. Operations like `install`, `update`, and `uninstall` only modify the **source** directory — `sync` propagates those changes to all targets.

This lets you:
- **Batch changes** — Install 5 skills, then sync once instead of 5 times
- **Preview first** — Run `sync --dry-run` before applying
- **Stay in control** — You decide when targets update

**Note:** `pull` is the only command that auto-syncs, because its intent is "bring everything up to date."

See [Why Sync is a Separate Step](/docs/understand/source-and-targets#why-sync-is-a-separate-step) for the full design rationale.

### How do I sync across multiple machines?

Use git-based cross-machine sync:

```bash
# Machine A: push changes
skillshare push -m "Add new skill"

# Machine B: pull and sync
skillshare pull
```

See [Cross-Machine Sync](/docs/how-to/sharing/cross-machine-sync) for full setup.

### What if I accidentally delete a skill through a symlink?

If you have git initialized (recommended), recover with:

```bash
cd ~/.config/skillshare/skills
git checkout -- deleted-skill/
```

Or restore from backup:
```bash
skillshare restore claude
```

### What if I accidentally uninstall a skill?

Uninstalled skills are moved to trash and kept for 7 days. Restore with:

```bash
skillshare trash list                  # See what's in trash
skillshare trash restore my-skill      # Restore to source
skillshare sync                        # Sync back to targets
```

If the skill was installed from a remote source, you can also reinstall:

```bash
skillshare install github.com/user/repo/my-skill
skillshare sync
```

For project mode, trash is at `.skillshare/trash/` within the project directory. Use `-p` flag with trash commands.

Run `skillshare doctor` to see current trash status (item count, size, age).

### What's the difference between backup and trash?

| | backup | trash |
|---|---|---|
| **Protects** | target directories (sync snapshots) | source skills (uninstall) |
| **Location** | `~/.local/share/skillshare/backups/` | `~/.local/share/skillshare/trash/` |
| **Triggered by** | `sync`, `target remove` | `uninstall` |
| **Restore with** | `skillshare restore <target>` | `skillshare trash restore <name>` |
| **Auto-cleanup** | manual (`backup --cleanup`) | 7 days |

They are complementary — backup protects targets from sync changes, trash protects source skills from accidental deletion.

### Can I sync specific skills to specific CLIs?

Yes. For example, skill A only to Claude, skill B to Gemini and Codex, skill C to all:

**Option 1: `targets` field in SKILL.md** (set by skill author)

```yaml
# skills/skill-a/SKILL.md
---
name: skill-a
targets: [claude]
---
```

```yaml
# skills/skill-b/SKILL.md
---
name: skill-b
targets: [gemini, codex]
---
```

```yaml
# skills/skill-c/SKILL.md — no targets field = syncs to all
---
name: skill-c
---
```

**Option 2: `include`/`exclude` filters in config** (set by consumer)

```yaml
# ~/.config/skillshare/config.yaml
targets:
  claude:
    path: ~/.claude/skills
    include: [skill-a, skill-c]
  codex:
    path: ~/.codex/skills
    include: [skill-b, skill-c]
```

Both approaches can be combined — config filters are applied first, then the skill-level `targets` field. See [Skill Format — `targets`](/docs/understand/skill-format#targets) and [Configuration — filters](/docs/reference/targets/configuration#skill-level-targets).

## Targets

### Using universal alongside npx skills

The `universal` target points to `~/.agents/skills`, the same directory used by the [npx skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills). Both tools can manage this directory simultaneously with some caveats:

**What works:**
- In merge mode (default), skillshare creates **symlinks** in `~/.agents/skills/`; npx skills creates **real directories**. They coexist as long as skill names don't collide.
- skillshare's prune logic only removes entries it manages — it won't delete files installed by npx skills.
- Agent CLIs (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) read directories directly, so they see skills from both tools.

**What to watch out for:**
- **Name collision** — If both tools install a skill with the same name, the last sync/install wins. Avoid installing the same skill through both tools.
- **Copy mode is more aggressive** — In copy mode (`skillshare target universal --mode copy`), skillshare overwrites managed directories on every sync. If npx skills modifies a same-named skill between syncs, skillshare will replace it. Merge mode (default) only creates symlinks, which is safer for coexistence.
- **`npx skills list` won't show skillshare skills** — The npx skills CLI tracks installs via a lock file (`~/.agents/.skill-lock.json`), not by scanning the directory. Skills synced by skillshare won't appear in `npx skills list -g`, but they **are** visible to agent CLIs.
- **Other agent-specific targets still useful** — `universal` and `claude` point to different paths (`~/.agents/skills` vs `~/.claude/skills`). Selecting both is safe and not redundant.

**Recommended workflow:**
```bash
# Use skillshare as your primary skill manager
skillshare install github.com/user/skills --track
skillshare sync

# Use npx skills only for one-off community installs you don't need to sync
npx skills add someone/skill -g
```

:::tip
Keep the universal target in **merge mode** (default) for the safest coexistence with npx skills. Avoid switching to copy mode unless you don't use npx skills at all.
:::

### I used `claude-code` (or `gemini-cli`, etc.) as a project target — is that still valid?

Yes. Old project target names like `claude-code`, `gemini-cli`, `github-copilot` still resolve via aliases. However, the canonical name is now the same as the global name (e.g., `claude`, `gemini`, `copilot`). We recommend updating your `.skillshare/config.yaml` to use the short name:

```yaml
# Before
targets:
  - claude-code

# After
targets:
  - claude
```

### How does `target remove` work? Is it safe?

Yes, it's safe:

1. **Backup** — Creates backup of the target
2. **Detect mode** — Checks if symlink or merge mode
3. **Unlink** — Removes all skillshare-managed symlinks, copies source content back as real files. In merge mode, only symlinks pointing to the source directory are removed; local (non-symlink) skills are preserved.
4. **Update config** — Removes target from config.yaml

This is why `skillshare target remove` is safe, while `rm -rf ~/.claude/skills` would delete your source files.

### Why is `rm -rf` on a target dangerous?

In symlink mode, the entire target directory is a symlink to source. Deleting it deletes source.

In merge mode, each skill is a symlink. Deleting a skill through the symlink deletes the source file.

**Always use:**
```bash
skillshare target remove <name>   # Safe
skillshare uninstall <skill>      # Safe
```

## Tracked Repos

### How do tracked repos differ from regular skills?

| Aspect | Regular Skill | Tracked Repo |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Source | Copied to source | Cloned with `.git` |
| Update | `install --update` | `update <name>` (git pull) |
| Prefix | None | `_` prefix |
| Nested skills | Flattened | Flattened with `__` |

### Why the underscore prefix?

The `_` prefix identifies tracked repositories:
- Helps you distinguish from regular skills
- Prevents name collisions
- Shows in listings clearly

---

## Skills

### What's the SKILL.md format?

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description
---

# Skill Name

Instructions for the AI...
```

See [Skill Format](/docs/understand/skill-format) for full details.

### What does "unknown target" warning mean?

When running `skillshare check` or `skillshare doctor`, you may see:

```
! Skill targets: my-skill: unknown target "*"
```

This means the skill's `SKILL.md` frontmatter has a `targets` field with an unrecognized name — often `"*"` (wildcard). skillshare expects **exact target names** (e.g., `claude`, `cursor`, `codex`), not glob patterns.

**If you want a skill to sync to all targets**, omit the `targets` field entirely:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Works everywhere
# no targets field = syncs to all targets
---
```

**If this warning is from a third-party skill**, the skill author used an unsupported syntax. You can:
1. **Ignore the warning** — the skill still installs, it just won't auto-filter to specific targets
2. **Fork and fix** — Remove or correct the `targets` field in the skill's `SKILL.md`

See [Skill Format — `targets`](/docs/understand/skill-format#targets) for the full specification.

### Can a skill have multiple files?

Yes. A skill directory can contain:
- `SKILL.md` (required)
- Any additional files (examples, templates, etc.)

Reference them in your SKILL.md instructions.

---

## Performance

### Sync seems slow

Check for large files in your skills directory. Add ignore patterns:

```yaml
# ~/.config/skillshare/config.yaml
ignore:
  - "**/.DS_Store"
  - "**/.git/**"
  - "**/node_modules/**"
  - "**/*.log"
```

### How many skills can I have?

No hard limit. Performance depends on:
- Number of skills
- Size of skill files
- Number of targets

Thousands of small skills work fine.

---

## Backups

### Where are backups stored?

```
~/.local/share/skillshare/backups/<timestamp>/
```

### How long are backups kept?

By default, indefinitely. Clean up with:
```bash
skillshare backup --cleanup
```

---

## Agents

### What's the difference between agents and skills?

Skills are **directories** containing a `SKILL.md` file (and optionally helpers, examples, templates). Agents are **single `.md` files** with frontmatter — no nested structure. Both support install, sync, audit, check, backup, and trash.

See [Agents](/docs/understand/agents) for the full comparison and the agent file format.

### Which targets support agents?

Out of the box: `claude`, `cursor`, `augment`, `opencode` (plus the `universal` alias). Other targets are silently skipped during agent sync with a `target(s) skipped for agents (no agents path)` warning. You can add an agent path manually by editing `config.yaml`:

```yaml
targets:
  myapp:
    path: ~/myapp/skills
    agents:
      path: ~/myapp/agents
```

### How do I disable a single agent without deleting it?

Use the `disable` command (or edit `.agentignore` directly):

```bash
skillshare disable my-agent --kind agent     # Adds entry to .agentignore
skillshare enable my-agent --kind agent      # Removes the entry
```

`.agentignore` lives in the agents source root (`~/.config/skillshare/agents/.agentignore` globally, `.skillshare/agents/.agentignore` in project mode) and uses [gitignore syntax](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore). A `.agentignore.local` overlay is also supported for local-only overrides.

### Can I backup agents in project mode?

Yes — and **only** agents. `backup` is not allowed in project mode for skills, but the agents flow is the explicit exception:

```bash
skillshare backup -p agents     # Backs up project agent targets
skillshare backup -p --all      # Same as above; --all narrows to agents in project mode
```

If you forget the `agents` filter, you'll see `backup is not supported in project mode (except for agents)`. Same rule applies to `restore`. Agent backups are stored under `<target>-agents/` next to the regular skill backups.

## Security

### Can I trust third-party skills?

Skills are instructions for your AI agent — a malicious skill could tell the AI to exfiltrate secrets or run destructive commands. skillshare mitigates this with a built-in security scanner:

- **Auto-scan on install** — Every skill is scanned during `skillshare install`
- **CRITICAL findings block** — Prompt injection, data exfiltration, credential access are blocked by default
- **Manual scan** — Run `skillshare audit` to scan all installed skills at any time

See [audit command](/docs/reference/commands/audit) for the full list of detection patterns.

### What if audit blocks my install?

If a skill triggers a CRITICAL finding, installation is blocked. You have two options:

1. **Review the finding** — Check if it's a false positive (e.g., a documentation example)
2. **Force install** — Use `--force` to bypass the check if you trust the source

```bash
skillshare install suspicious-skill --force
```

### Does audit catch everything?

No scanner is perfect. `skillshare audit` catches common patterns like prompt injection, `curl`/`wget` with secrets, credential file access, and obfuscated payloads. Always review skills from untrusted sources manually.
